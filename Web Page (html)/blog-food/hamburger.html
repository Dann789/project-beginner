                <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 1/2 pounds ground beef (80% to 85% lean)</li>
                    <li>Kosher salt</li>
                    <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
                    <li>4 to 6 hamburger buns, split</li>
                    <li>Butter or oil, for the pan</li>
                    <li>4 to 6 slices cheese, such as cheddar, swiss, American, or provolone (optional)</li>
                    <li>Burger toppings: sliced tomatoes, sliced onions, lettuce, ketchup, mustard, BBQ sauce, pickles, relish</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Instrusctions</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Divide the ground beef.</b> Divide the ground beef into 4 or 6 portions, depending on the number of burgers you would like to make.</li>
                    <li><b>Shape the patties.</b> Gently press each portion of ground beef into a disk about 1-inch thick. Press the middle to create a shallow "dimple" and pat the edges into a round — the patty should look like a frisbee and be slightly larger than your burger buns. Don't worry if there are some cracks in the edges; try not to mash the beef too much as you shape the patties.</li>
                    <li><b>Warm the pan.</b> Heat a pat of butter or a teaspoon of oil in a griddle or large skillet over medium heat.</li>
                    <li><b>Toast the buns.</b> Working in batches if needed, place the bun halves cut-side down in the warm butter or oil. Toast until the surface is golden-brown. Transfer the toasted buns to a serving plate.</li>
                    <li><b>Increase the heat to medium-high.</b> Increase the heat to medium-high, and keep a careful eye on the pan. When you see the first wisp of smoke, you're ready to cook the burgers.</li>
                    <li><b>Cook the burgers for 3 to 5 minutes.</b> Place the burger patties in the hot pan, leaving a little space between each one. Work in batches if necessary. The burgers should sizzle on contact — if they don't, nudge the heat up a little. Generously season with salt and pepper, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
                    <li><b>Flip the burgers and cook another 3 to 5 minutes.</b> Quickly slide a spatula under the burgers and flip to the other side. You should see a dark brown sear on the underside — if not, increase your heat next time. Season the other side generously with salt and pepper, and cook for another 3 to 5 minutes to your preferred doneness. If the burger falls apart when you flip, just press the edges together and carry on — your burger will still be great!</li>
                    <li><b>To make cheeseburgers.</b> If making cheeseburgers, top the burgers with cheese as soon as you flip them. If the cheese isn't melting fast enough, cover the pan with a lid or other dome to encourage the cheese to melt.</li>
                    <li><b>Finish the burgers.</b> When the burgers have finished cooking, transfer them to the toasted buns and finish with your favorite burger toppings.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>NB:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Double-batch of burgers:</b> If you're making burgers for a crowd, cook the burgers in batches and cook the burgers to just under the desired doneness level. Transfer the cooked burgers to a baking sheet and keep warm in a 300°F oven while you finish the rest of the batches.</li>
                    <li><b>Storage:</b> Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.</li>
                </ul>
